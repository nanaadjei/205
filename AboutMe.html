        <p>I am a Business Information Technology undergraduate studying at Coventry University. Along with completing my degree, I also produce music and DJ. On this page you will be able to hear beats I have made, see the latest updates and progression made on future tracks and ideas in addition to discovering music which you may have never heard of before. I hope you enjoy.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in London, I spent the earlier stages in my life living in Harrow with my brother and parents before moving to Enfield in 2005. From there I went on to attend Chancellor's School. As a child my parents asked me if I had any interests, to which I naturally answered music. From there I went on to learn both piano and guitar as well as taking part in extra-curricular activities such as school bands and the school choir. Learning instruments at an early age definitely has helped me to develop my skills and work towards a sound which I feel is representative of myself and the time that I live in. </p>

        <p>I began producing around the age of 15 when I started doing my GCSE's, however the quality of material created then was not up to the standard it is now. I started off making very experimental beats as i was trying to find my feet with the software I was using, but as I got older and more experienced with Logic the rewards and outcomes soon followed. I started releasing music under the alias Kwam. because the name was given to me in school and it has stuck ever since, plus Kwame is my middle name so it makes sence. But in the future who knows I might go under a new alias if it is neccessary.</p>

        <h2>Influences</h2>
        <p>Although I couldnt understand at the time, I have to take a moment to thank my parents for moving myself and my brother out of harrow as this experience enabled us to see another way of life and explore new types of music which we otherwise wouldnt have listened to. My taste in music has become very broad as I love discovering new sounds but growing up I would listen to anything from Snoop Dogg, Pharrell, Bob Marley and Kanye west to bands like Hiatus Kaiyote, Foals, Friendly Fires and Passion Pit. And of course theres the electronic music...</p>

        <h2>Future Developments</h2>
        <p>Along with completing my degree, I am trying to complete my concept for the first EP I hope to release called, which so far is called The Life Cycle. Through this extended playlist I plan on raising issues that arent normally spoken about in underground and mainstream music such as life as a student and growing up as a young minority male in the system. The point of the lifecycle is also to highlight how we as humans work in patterns therefore if you do not break cycles of bad behaviour, it ultimately will have a detramental effect. But I dont want to give too much away you have to hear it for yourselves.</p>
