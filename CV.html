    <h2>Project Highlights and Achievements</h2>
    <p>I was the project manager of a group of 6 during my first year where we were tasked with trying to create an innovative product for the technology market. This role required me to motivate my team in addition to providing support to my colleagues to ensure we all maintained the same common goal. I found the best way to monitor the team’s progress and complete tasks with time to spare was to make sure deadlines were always met through effective planning. I found using gant charts really helpful for this as it gave structure to the timings and allowed me to assess how long we could spend on each part of the assignment. For the project I had to compile a report consisting of the research and plan we had to bring the product to market based upon the requirements specifications that were gathered. The experience allowed me to use my social skills in a way which allowed all members of the group to feel comfortable to contribute and communicate with myself as well as each other, which made resolving issues professional and comfortable. We achieved a 2:1 for the project which I was reasonably happy with however I feel if we were to do the project again I would change the product we promoted as we decided to endorse a basic website. I feel if we made a different selection it may have given us more scope to be creative with our ideas to produce a more innovative product.</p>

    <h2>Extracurricular Activities and interests</h2>
    <p>I was the basketball captain for my school team and I also played football for my school’s A-team. Furthermore, I was in the school choir where we went on a tour to Spain and performed in a number of incredible venues including the Basilica in Barcelona where I used my perfect pitch to ensure we sang acapella in tune. My team leadership and team player qualities proved valuable to my peers and the teachers who took us as my Head of Music sent a commendation email on our return. I am also a Grade 5 pianist, I produce, and play the guitar as well as djing. I also enjoy going to live and underground music events and appreciate a broad range genres from house to hip hop, jazz, soul, grime and reggae.</p>
